{"id":"sysengn-l0y","title":"Fix Terminal Input Case and Resize Gaps","description":"Fix issues with terminal input casing and layout filling.\n\nRequirements:\n1.  **Input Case Sensitivity**: Currently `e.key` returns capitalized keys (e.g. 'L' for 'l'). Ensure input respects Shift state to send correct case.\n2.  **Full Width Resizing**: The terminal content often has a gap on the right because character width calculation is imperfect or strict integer column division leaves remainder.\n    -   Switch font to a known monospace font if possible (e.g. 'Roboto Mono' from Flet asset if available, or standard system fonts).\n    -   Adjust layout: Instead of centering or fixed width, ensure the `Column` of text lines fills the container.\n    -   Maybe use `expand=True` on the Text controls? No, text is character grid.\n    -   **Solution**:\n        -   Calculate columns more aggressively (round up/down carefully).\n        -   Or, accept the gap (it's a terminal grid) but center it?\n        -   Or better: The issue is likely that `cols = width / 9` underestimates. If font is actually smaller, we get gap.\n        -   We should try to measure text? Flet doesn't allow sync measurement.\n        -   **Workaround**: Use a slightly smaller character width divisor to get *more* columns, filling the space better. Or accept that terminals are grid-based and won't fit pixel-perfectly.\n        -   BUT, the user says \"fraction of the drawer\". This implies  calculation is way off.\n        -   Debug: Check . 9px might be too wide for size 14 font? Or too narrow?\n        -   Let's reduce font size or adjust constant.\n\nTasks:\n1.  **Fix Input Case**: Update `_map_key` to check `e.shift` and `e.key`. If key is a letter, and shift is False, lowercase it. Note: Flet `e.key` usually returns the *logical* key (e.g. \"A\" if Shift+a pressed, \"a\" if just a?). Wait, Flet docs say `key` is the key name. For letters, it might always be uppercase in some backends?\n    -   Actually, standard Flet/Flutter  property usually respects case. If  is 'L' when user types 'l', then we need to check .\n    -   However, often  is the physical key or named key.\n    -   We should check  if available? Flet  has  (name),  (bool),  (bool),  (bool),  (bool). It doesn't have .\n    -   So we must map: if  and it's alpha:\n        -   If  is True -\u003e Upper.\n        -   If  is False -\u003e Lower.\n    -   Also handle Caps Lock? Flet doesn't report Caps Lock state easily.\n    -   Assumption: User types 'l', Flet reports 'L' key with shift=False. We map to 'l'.\n\n2.  **Improve Resize Fill**:\n    -   Update :\n        -   Log the incoming width.\n        -   Adjust  constant. 9px for 14pt monospace is a guess.\n        -   Maybe use  and ?\n        -   Or just try to fit more columns.\n    -   Also, ensure the container background () fills the whole drawer, so the \"gap\" is just empty black space (standard terminal behavior), not \"white\" or transparent space.\n    -   The user says \"fraction of the drawer\". Maybe  passed to  is incorrect?\n    -   Update  to pass correct width (subtract handle width?).\n\n3.  **Verify**: Test typing 'ls' and resizing.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T06:38:32.452485437-06:00","created_by":"jd","updated_at":"2026-01-09T06:41:17.453055012-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T06:41:17.453055012-06:00","close_reason":"Fixed terminal input case sensitivity and resize gaps by adjusting char width heuristic"}

{"id":"sysengn-vz8","title":"Refine Terminal: Resize Logic and Command Handling","description":"Fix issues with terminal command handling and resizing behavior.\n\nRequirements:\n1.  **Command Handling**: Currently, individual keystrokes are sent as executed commands (appended with newline). This breaks standard typing.\n    -   Update `ShellManager.write`: It should send raw bytes/characters to the PTY, *without* forcibly appending `\\n`.\n    -   Update `TerminalComponent` (or keyboard handler): Send specific keys (like Enter) as specific codes (e.g., `\\r`), and normal characters as-is.\n2.  **Resizing**: The `ResizeableSidePanel` changes width, but the `TerminalComponent` inside doesn't reflow or fill the space correctly.\n    -   Ensure `TerminalComponent` (and its inner `Text`/grid) expands to fill the parent container.\n    -   Pass resize events to `ShellManager` to update PTY window size (rows/cols) via `fcntl.ioctl(fd, termios.TIOCSWINSZ, ...)` so the shell knows the new dimensions.\n    -   Recalculate `pyte.Screen` size when UI resizes.\n\nTasks:\n1.  **Fix Shell Write Logic**: Update `ShellManager.write` to accept raw string/bytes and send them exactly as-is to the master FD. Remove auto-newline.\n2.  **Update Keyboard Handler**: Update `TerminalComponent._map_key` to ensure normal keys are just sent as characters, and Enter sends `\\r`.\n3.  **Implement PTY Resizing**: Add a `resize(rows, cols)` method to `ShellManager` that uses `fcntl` to set PTY size.\n4.  **Connect UI Resize to Shell**: In `TerminalComponent`, handle resize events (or monitor width changes) to calculate new columns/rows based on font metrics, update `pyte.Screen`, and call `shell.resize`.\n    -   Note: Flet doesn't have a direct 'on_resize' callback for Controls easily. We might infer it or just update it periodically/on-drag-end from the parent panel.\n    -   **Approach**: `ResizeableSidePanel` knows when it resizes. Pass a callback `on_resize(width)` to the content? Or content exposes a method.\n5.  **Verify**: Test typing 'ls' (should work), and resizing window (htop should reflow).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T06:13:54.00650205-06:00","created_by":"jd","updated_at":"2026-01-09T06:30:25.612050498-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T06:30:25.612050498-06:00","close_reason":"Terminal fixes implemented: shell write uses raw input, resize logic recalculates PTY size, and keyboard mapping handles special keys correctly."}
